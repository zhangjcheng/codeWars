Instructions:
A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.


Sample Tests:
pangram = "The quick, brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!"
Test.assert_equals(is_pangram(pangram), True)

B:
import string

def is_pangram(s):
    return set(string.lowercase) <= set(s.lower())

T:
