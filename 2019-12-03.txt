Instructions：
Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

i.e.

Example：
friend ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"] `shouldBe` ["Ryan", "Mark"]

Sample Tests:
Test.assert_equals(friend(["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark",]), ["Ryan", "Mark"])


B：
def friend(x):
    return [f for f in x if len(f) == 4]
	
T：
