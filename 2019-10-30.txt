Instructions：
The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollar bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.

Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.

Can Vasya sell a ticket to every person and give change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people queue?

Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to every person and give change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return NO.

Examples：
tickets([25, 25, 50]) # => YES 
tickets([25, 100]) # => NO. Vasya will not have enough money to give change to 100 dollars
tickets([25, 25, 50, 50, 100]) # => NO. Vasya will not have the right bills to give 75 dollars of change (you can't make two bills of 25 from one of 50)


Sample Tests:
test.assert_equals(tickets([25, 25, 50]), "YES")
test.assert_equals(tickets([25, 100]), "NO")

Solution:
def tickets(people):
  till = {100.0:0, 50.0:0, 25.0:0}

  for paid in people:
    till[paid] += 1
    change = paid-25.0
    
    for bill in (50,25):
      while (bill <= change and till[bill] > 0):
        till[bill] -= 1
        change -= bill

    if change != 0:
      return 'NO'
        
  return 'YES'
